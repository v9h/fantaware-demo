## What the FUCK is FantaWare PREMIUM?

Basically better version that includes my own edits to public code and private code only available to paying customers (exactly 3$ for this for even more cool stuff every time I find something quite interesting...)

## I DON'T PLAY DOLLHOUSE, I WANT THIS SHIT AT ITS FULL ABILITIES!!!

Easy, buy premium and make an ISSUE regarding your suggestion for the premium version which supports any games you (or I) care about.

(this can also be used to suggest new games)
